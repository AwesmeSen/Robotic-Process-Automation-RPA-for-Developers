Building Digital Workforce
This is the promise of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) that emerges in the last few
years as a set of software tools and platforms that can automate tasks on rules-based
business process. Recent case studies report the beneﬁts of the application of RPA in
different business process and some authors propose the criteria for selecting the
process for automation. One of these criteria is highly structured tasks, corresponding
typically to back ofﬁce business process like ﬁnance, procurement and human
resources. From the research. studies have found beneﬁts of the application of RPA
on front ofﬁce business process like selling. requirements handling or after sales
support. Considering the above, the question is "What are the results on applying RPA
to service business process with front and back ofﬁce activities”?
Robotic Process Automation (RPA) emerges as software-based
solution to automate rules-based business processes that involve
routine tasks, structured data and deterministic outcomes. Recent
studies report the benefits of the application of RPA in terms of
productivity, costs, speed and error reduction. Most of these
applications were carried out on back ofﬁce business process where
the customer is not directly involved, therefore a case study was
conducted on a BPO provider to verify the beneﬁts and results of
applying RPA to a service business process with front and back ofﬁce
activities. The results show that productivity improvement is the main
benefit of RPA.
