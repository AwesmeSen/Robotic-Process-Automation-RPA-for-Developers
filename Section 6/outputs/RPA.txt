Building Digital Workforce
This is the promise of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) that emerges in the last few
years as a set of software tools and platforms that can automate tasks on rules-based
business process. Recent case studies report the benefits of the application of RPA in 
different business process and some authors propose the criteria for selecting the 
process for automation. One of these criteria is highly structured tasks, corresponding 
typically to back office business process like finance, procurement and human 
resources. From the research, studies have found benefits of the application of RPA 
on front office business process like selling, requirements handling or after sales 
support. Considering the above, the question is “What are the results on applying RPA 
to service business process with front and back office activities”?
